## Description

Morse Code Flashlight is an app which helps users send out messages using their devices' flashlight in the form of Morse Code.
Users can also use this application as a basic flashlight app if their device does not have built-in flashlight support.

This app is my first Android app which I build independently without referencing any existing tutorials. The goal of building 
this app is to practice what I learnt from the [Official Android Developer Tutorial Courses](https://developer.android.com/courses), 
and this app also serves practical purposes.

This project is built with Java with Android's Room Database.

## Features
- Basic Flashlight (ON/OFF)
- Siren Flashlight (Rapid Flashing) by long pressing ON/OFF button
- SOS Morse Code Siren (Flashes SOS sequence indefinitely)
- Custom Morse Code Input (Translates user's sentence input into Morse Code)
- And more!
